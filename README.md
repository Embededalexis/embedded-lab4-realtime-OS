# embedded-lab4-realtime-OS
Implemented the internals of a real-time operating system. Real time operating systems have a number of subsystems, but their most important functions are task scheduling, resource allocation and memory protection (a form of fault isolation). The first deals with basic infrastructure, context switching, task man- agement, concurrency control through mutexes and interface layers. The second deals with admission control and the priority inheritance locking discipline.
